The IDE allows viewing the camera&apos;s frame buffer, accessing sensor controls, uploading scripts to the camera via serial over USB (or WiFi\/BLE if available) and includes a set of image processing tools to generate tags, thresholds, keypoints etc...\r\n\r\nThe OpenMV project is a THP semifinalist and was successfully funded via Kickstarter back in 2015 and has come a long way since then.","image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.hackaday.io\/images\/5817461406329458960.JPG","views":211489,"comments":211,"followers":3835,"skulls":1401,"logs":19,"details":1,"instruction":0,"components":10,"images":6,"created":1401763612,"updated":1554388653,"tags":["python","arm","camera","STm32f429","machine vision","TheHackadayPrize","OpenMV","STM32F407","ongoing project","stm32f7"]}
