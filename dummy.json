With this device, you can generate and safely store long and complex passwords. A personal PIN locked smartcard allows the decryption of your credentials and ensures that only you have access to them. Simply visit a website and the device will ask for your confirmation to enter your credentials when login is required.\r\nThe Mooltipass is a standalone device connected through USB, is completely driver-less and is compatible with all major operating systems on PCs, Macs and Smartphones.

","description":"3D printing has the potential to democratize manufacturing. Since 3D printers are easy to use and low cost, they allow anyone to make incredibly complex things. I&apos;m confident that anyone reading this has seen something cool made on a low cost hobby grade 3D printer. The technology has opened up new doors to makers and hackers.\r\n\r\nHowever the capabilities of 3D printers are limited by requirement of human operation. The need of manual part removal prevents 3D printers from being used for mass production purposes. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to build a fully autonomous 3D printer. A 3D printer that can print a continuous stream of parts without user interaction. The finished machine is capable of independently ejecting and starting print jobs. Additional, the 3D printer&apos;s conveyor belt mechanism allows it make infinitely long prints. The Automatic Infinite 3D Printer (i3D) allows any small business, organization, and person to leverage the power of a factory.","image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.hackaday.io\/images\/6205861540205408609.jpg","views":109226,"comments":46,"followers":1833,"skulls":598,"logs":26,"details":1,"instruction":11,"components":17,"images":6,"created":1522650562,"updated":1583512484,"tags":["python","electron","3d printing","automation","hardware","2018hackadayprize","node.js","ConveyOr Belt","Robotics","ongoing project"]},{"id":1279,"url":"https:\/\/hackaday.io\/project\/1279-ramanpi-raman-spectrometer","owner_id":2424,"name":"ramanPi - Raman Spectrometer","summary":"The open source 3D Printable Raman Spectrometer using a RaspberryPi and easy to find off the shelf components..","description":"The ORIGINAL open source 3D Printable Raman Spectrometer that uses a raspberryPi, a really bright laser and some parts you can grab from your favorite suppliers..!\r\n\r\nBASIC DESIGN GOALS:\r\n1.
